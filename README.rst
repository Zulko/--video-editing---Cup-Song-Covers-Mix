This repository contains a IPython Notebook with the code for a video where I mix together 60 covers of the famous Cup Song (You're gonna miss me when I'm gone).

Not sure anyone else will ever be able to gather all the video files necessary to make this script work, it is just for information/demonstration purposes.
