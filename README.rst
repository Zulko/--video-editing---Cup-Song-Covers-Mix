This repository contains a IPython Notebook with the code for a video where I mix together 60 covers of the famous Cup Song (You're gonna miss me when I'm gone).

See the script and the video there_ .

Not sure anyone else will ever be able to gather all the video files necessary to make this script work, it is just for information/demonstration purposes.
